My Project for the Xilinx University Open Harware Contest (2016)

A hardware and software implementation of a heart rate monitor. The project involves developing and testing and algorithm for the detection of the QRS complex in ECG signals. First Matlab will be used to prototype the algorithm. The hardware implementation will be then done on a ZYBO board.
